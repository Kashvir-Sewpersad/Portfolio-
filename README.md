# 🧠 C# Programming Portfolio  

Welcome to my *C# Programming Portfolio* — a collection of programming  projects that demonstrate my skills, creativity, and technical ability in Programming in C#. 


## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a *portfolio of evidence* - POE - displayig  my competency in various areas of C# programming . each project file shows a diffrent section of cooding concepts being implemented and following goood coding practices.
